# Releases & Changelog

Where to get Genie 5 and what changed in each build. Downloads live on the [Releases page](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/releases); the [latest release](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/releases/latest) is always the one to grab. For how to install each download, see [Installation](Installation); for staying current after that, [Keeping Up to Date](Updates).

> Genie 5 is **alpha**. Versions are tagged `v5.0.0-alpha.N`. Builds are unsigned for now (Windows/macOS show a first-launch warning — see [Installation](Installation#platform-first-launch-notes)); signed Windows builds are expected from an upcoming release.

## Latest: v5.0.0-alpha.4.2 — portable mode for the downloadable builds

The alpha.4.1 fix was only half the story: it got portable-first discovery right, but the **downloadable** Windows/macOS builds are packaged so the app runs from an internal `current/` subfolder (the one with `Update.exe` beside it). Genie looked for your data *inside* that subfolder, found none, and fell back to the per-user OS folder (`%APPDATA%` on Windows) — so a portable unzip with your `Config` / `Scripts` / `Maps` beside `Genie.exe` still leaked into the user profile.

Now Genie resolves its data to the **program folder** — the one holding `Genie.exe` and your data folders — which is both where you put your files and where they survive an update (the `current/` subfolder is replaced wholesale each update).

> **📡 Still on the beta channel — that's intentional.** Every alpha ships as a GitHub **pre-release**, so the Core updater defaults to **beta**; that's what lets **Help → Check for Updates** see new alpha builds. Already on an earlier alpha? Open the Updates dialog and you'll be offered **alpha.4.2** as a delta.

**Fixes**

- **Portable mode now works on the packaged downloads** — discovery resolves the data root to the program folder (beside `Genie.exe` / `Update.exe`), not the internal `current/` folder the app launches from, so a portable copy is truly self-contained and survives updates. A freshly-extracted portable build is recognized even before its first `Config` folder exists ([#38](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/38)).

## v5.0.0-alpha.4.1 — portable-first storage

A focused point release that fixes where Genie keeps its data. Previously a portable copy could still read and write the per-user OS folder (`%APPDATA%` on Windows) instead of its own; now **data beside the executable always wins**, so a portable unzip is truly self-contained.

> **📡 Still on the beta channel — that's intentional.** Every alpha ships as a GitHub **pre-release**, so the Core updater defaults to **beta**; that's what lets **Help → Check for Updates** see new alpha builds. Already on an earlier alpha? Open the Updates dialog and you'll be offered **alpha.4.1** as a delta.

**Fixes**

- **Portable-first data discovery** — a copy of Genie with its data folder beside the `.exe` now runs fully local; nothing is read from or written to the per-user OS folder. The old build only did this when a `genie5.portable` marker file was present, which the release zip wasn't reliably shipping — so portable installs leaked into `%APPDATA%` ([#38](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/38), [#74](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/74)).
- **First-run location prompt** — a fresh install with no data in either place now asks where to keep it (portable, beside the exe — the default; or your user folder). The choice persists and is never asked again. See [Application Folders](Application-Folders).

## v5.0.0-alpha.4 — JavaScript scripting, typed login & dev tools

The biggest alpha to walk the lands of Elanthia yet: `.js` scripting, connect-by-typing, and two new tools for the tinkering adventurer — plus a satchel of scripting and mapper fixes to ease the road ahead.

> **📡 Still on the beta channel — that's intentional.** Every alpha ships as a GitHub **pre-release**, so the Core updater defaults to **beta**; that's what lets **Help → Check for Updates** see new alpha builds. Already on an earlier alpha? Open the Updates dialog and you'll be offered **alpha.4** as a delta.

**Scripting**

- **JavaScript (`.js`) array scripts** — run `.js` scripts alongside `.cmd`, on a pure-C# [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) engine (no native deps; identical on Windows/macOS/Linux). A `genie.*` API covers `put`/`send`, `waitFor`/`waitForRe`/`matchWait`, `pause`, timers, and session/script vars — straight-line procedural code with real blocking calls. Memory + runaway-loop guards included ([#21](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/21)).
- **`#connect` / `#reconnect` / `#lichconnect`** — log in by typing or from a script (Genie 4 parity): saved-profile, explicit, and reconnect-last forms, plus the Lich variant; passwords masked in history ([#46](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/46)).
- **New reserved variables** — `$gamehost` / `$gameport` (resolved game endpoint), `$roomnote`; `$zoneid` now reads `0` off-map ([#45](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/45)).

**Tools**

- **Analyst Capture** — a redacted, recipe-driven session capture (raw XML + parsed streams + a meta sidecar) for parser/analysis work; other players' speech is stripped by default.
- **Performance overlay** — live per-stage pipeline timing (Parse / Scripts / JavaScript / Triggers / Highlights / …) plus a running-`.js` list, behind the Performance menu.

**Fixes**

- **`#goto` no longer floods the game** — it waits for a confirmed room change between moves instead of overrunning the typeahead buffer ([#69](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/69)).
- **Mapper** — auto-hiding Details flyout; the Mapper floats by default; a new top-level **Maps** menu.
- **Docking** — blank tool panels after a close/reopen are fixed.
- **Connect errors** are now immediate and specific (bad password, character already in game) instead of a ~50-second retry loop.

## v5.0.0-alpha.3.6 — scripting, docking & UI polish

A quality-of-life batch that closes a run of community-reported issues, plus mapper-aware scripting.

> **📡 Still on the beta channel — that's intentional.** Every alpha ships as a GitHub **pre-release**, so the Core updater defaults to **beta**; that's what lets **Help → Check for Updates** see new alpha builds. Already on an earlier alpha? Open the Updates dialog and you'll be offered **3.6** as a small delta. See [Keeping Up to Date](Updates).

**Scripting**

- **Mapper variables for scripts** — `$roomid`, `$zoneid`, and `$zonename` now track the mapper's current location (Genie 4 parity), so scripts can branch on where you are. Thanks to **@dylb0t** ([#67](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/pull/67), [#45](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/45)).
- **Room/zone tags + `#goto @tag`** — tag rooms or zones from the mapper, then route to the nearest room carrying a tag.
- **Paused/delayed scripts resume reliably** — fixed a stall where `pause` / `delay` could hang a script ([#61](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/61)).
- **`#edit <script>`** opens the script in your editor instead of running it ([#63](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/63)).

**Interface**

- **Character-Account identity** in the title bar and profile picker, e.g. `Renucci-MONIL` ([#4](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/4)).
- **Browser-style selection** — click-drag to select across multiple lines in the Game window and copy ([#34](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/34)).
- **Docking** — draggable centre splitters; a panel dragged to a new spot keeps that spot after floating or closing ([#35](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/35)).
- **Windowed (MDI) document mode** with Genie 4-style window decorations ([#52](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/52)).
- **Config** — per-profile settings with a global fallback ([#60](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/60)); Room-panel fields wrap; script output is classified as Script Lines.

## v5.0.0-alpha.3.4 — connection, mapper & update-cycle test

A connection/mapper/quality-of-life batch, and the build we're using to exercise the **in-app update cycle** end-to-end.

> **📡 You're on the beta channel — that's intentional.** Every alpha ships as a GitHub **pre-release**, so Genie now defaults its Core updater to the **beta** channel. That's what lets **Help → Check for Updates** see new alpha builds. On **alpha.3.2**? Open the Updates dialog and you should be offered **3.4** as a small delta — install it and the app restarts on the new version. (Switching to **stable** shows "up to date" until 5.0.0 ships — stay on **beta** to ride the test releases.) See [Keeping Up to Date](Updates).

**Connecting**

- **Connection-mode dropdown** in the Connect dialog — **Direct (SGE login)** or **Lich proxy (local)**; the dialog shows the right fields for each, and the choice saves with the profile.
- **Command-line startup** — launch pre-pointed at a connection, no dialog: `Genie.exe --profile=<name>`, or `Genie.exe --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000` to attach to a local Lich proxy. Handy for headless-Lich setups and external launchers.
- **Per-profile data folder** — optionally keep a character's data (Config, Scripts, Maps, Plugins, Logs) in a folder you choose, e.g. a synced drive or USB stick. Blank = the default location.

**Mapper & quality of life**

- **`#goto` / `#go2`** — the typed/scripted equivalent of clicking a room: an attended, roundtime-gated walk by room id, note label, or title. Esc / any typed command / a disconnect interrupts it.
- **Numpad movement macros** seeded on a profile's first run (NumLock on): `8/2/4/6` = n/s/w/e, `7/9/1/3` = diagonals, `5` = out, `0` = down. Edit or remove any in the Macros panel.
- **Open Scripts Folder** now opens exactly the folder the script engine loads from.

**Policy posture (clarified)** — the policy docs now centre on DR's [Scripting Policy](https://elanthipedia.play.net/Policy:Scripting_policy): the line is being **responsive to the game**, not keeping the window focused, and it's the player's call. The auto-walk **idle pause** is now **optional and off by default**.

**Secure SGE auth (TLS)** — the Direct login handshake can now connect over TLS (port 7910) with a pinned server certificate, instead of the plaintext port. Plaintext remains available as a fallback.

**Fix** — recovered a class of silently-dropped game text when the server merges a response onto a held-item update.

## v5.0.0-alpha.3.2 — dock layout restore

- **Dock layout close→reopen restore** — closing and reopening a panel now restores it to its prior place in the docked tree instead of dropping it to a default spot.

## v5.0.0-alpha.3.1 — cross-platform companion (Linux + macOS)

The headline: **Genie 5 now has native downloads for all three platforms.** This is the cross-platform companion to alpha.3 — the **same codebase**, plus the Linux and macOS binaries that weren't ready when alpha.3 first shipped. It adds *platforms*, not features.

**First-ever native Genie client on Linux and macOS:**

- 🐧 **Linux x64** — `Genie5.AppImage`, a single-file executable for Ubuntu / Fedora / Debian / Arch / etc.
- 🍎 **macOS Apple Silicon (M1+)** — `Genie5-osx-Setup.pkg` installer, or `Genie5-osx-Portable.zip`.
- 🍎 **macOS Intel (pre-2020)** — `Genie5-osx-x64-Setup.pkg` / `Genie5-osx-x64-Portable.zip`.

On each of these platforms the **in-app updater** handles subsequent releases, just like Windows. Pick your download in the [Installation](Installation#download-a-pre-built-build-recommended) tables.

**Already on Windows alpha.3?** This is offered to you as a tiny delta through the in-app updater — nothing changes behaviourally.

**Read before you run:**

- **macOS** — unsigned, so Gatekeeper blocks the first launch. Right-click → **Open**, or `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path>`. ([details](Installation#macos--gatekeeper))
- **Linux** — `chmod +x Genie5.AppImage` first; install FUSE (`sudo apt install libfuse2`) if you see a FUSE error; minimal distros may need `fontconfig`. ([details](Installation#-linux))
- **Windows** — unchanged from alpha.3; SmartScreen still warns until builds are signed (code-signing is planned for an upcoming release).

> ⚠️ Linux and macOS are **brand-new, alpha-tier platforms** here. CI builds them cleanly, but no live-app smoke test has happened on either OS yet. First-tester reports — what works, what's broken, what renders with a weird font — are very welcome: [file an issue](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/issues/new) or post in [Discord](https://discord.gg/MtmzE2w).

## v5.0.0-alpha.3 — Integrated updater

The release that made Genie 5 **self-updating** — no more downloading a fresh zip every version.

- **Integrated updater** — one **Help → Check for Updates** dialog with three channels: **Core** (the app, via Velopack binary-diff updates that install and restart from inside the app), **Maps** (zone XML from the community repo), and **Plugins** (DLLs from configured feeds, with a new `#plugin` command to inspect / install / remove). The Help menu shows a badge when an update is available. It's an in-process system — distinct from Genie 4's separate `Lamp.exe`. See [Keeping Up to Date](Updates).
- **Windows installer** — `Genie5-win-Setup.exe` registers the app for auto-updates; from an alpha.3 install onward, new releases arrive in-app.
- **Code-signing pipeline (in progress)** — a tag-triggered workflow that submits the Windows build to the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) for approval and signing. This build is still unsigned; code-signing is expected to land in an upcoming release.

## Earlier milestones

These predate the current download/updater setup but mark where major subsystems landed:

- **alpha.2** — **Plugin system** shipped: load plugins from `Plugins/` with no rebuild, per-plugin isolation, the `#plugin` command, and the Experience-tracker example. See [Plugins](Plugins).
- **alpha.1** — first public alpha: SGE + Lich + replay connections, the StormFront XML parser, the GameState engine, the full Genie 4 `.cmd` [script engine](Scripting) and all the [rule engines](Configuration), the [mapper](Mapper) with click-to-walk, per-character encrypted [profiles](Connecting), and dockable [panels](The-Interface).

## Roadmap

For what's planned versus shipped, see the [project roadmap](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md). Wiki pages flag still-unshipped features with 🚧.
