# Text-to-Speech

Genie 5 can read the game aloud using natural neural voices that run **entirely
on your computer** — offline, free, and private. No game text ever leaves your
machine. It's built for blind and low-vision players, and useful for anyone who'd
rather listen than watch the screen.

Everything is **opt-in**: nothing is spoken until you turn it on.

## Quick start

```
#tts install          install the default voice (a one-time ~60 MB download)
#speak hello there     read a line aloud
#tts read on           auto-read whispers, talk, thoughts, and deaths
```

## Installing voices

Voices are downloaded on demand and stored under your data folder's `Voices`
directory (see [Application Folders](Application-Folders)).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `#tts install` | Download and select the default voice |
| `#tts install <name>` | Download a specific voice (e.g. `#tts install lessac`) |
| `#tts voices` | List available voices and which are installed |
| `#tts use <name>` | Switch the active voice |
| `#tts status` | Show the voice folder, installed voices, and read-aloud state |

Voices work identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Speaking text

- **`#speak <text>`** (alias **`#say`**) — read a line aloud. Works typed, from
  scripts, and as a trigger action.
- **`#tts stop`** — silence the current line and clear anything queued.

## Rate and volume

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `#tts rate <n>` | Speaking speed — `1` is the voice's natural pace, `0.5`–`3` (e.g. `#tts rate 1.5`) |
| `#tts volume <n>` | Loudness as a percentage, `0`–`100` |

Both apply from the next spoken line — no restart needed — and persist with
your other settings. Run either without a number to see the current value.

## Reading streams aloud

Turn on per-stream read-aloud to have Genie announce game text automatically.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `#tts read` | Show whether read-aloud is on and which streams are read |
| `#tts read on` / `#tts read off` | Master switch |
| `#tts read <stream>` | Add a stream (e.g. `#tts read combat`) and turn read-aloud on |
| `#tts mute <stream>` | Stop reading a stream |

Default streams are **whispers, talk, thoughts, deaths** — the "someone's
talking to me / something important happened" set. The chatty streams (combat,
atmospherics) and `main` are left off by default; add them if you want them.

Urgent lines (whispers, deaths) are spoken first and can interrupt ongoing
chatter, so you never miss a tell behind a wall of room text.

## Speaking alerts (triggers & highlights)

Any trigger or highlight can speak when it fires — your hand-picked "always
tell me about this" alerts. Add a final *speak* argument: `*` speaks the
matched line, any other text is spoken as-is (triggers expand `$1`-style
capture groups).

```
#trigger add {^(\w+) just arrived} {} {} {} {$1 just arrived}
#highlight add {black-clawed grelkin} {red} {} {string} {} {} {*}
```

The empty `{}` slots are the arguments you're skipping (action/class/sound for
triggers; background, match type, class, and sound for highlights). Spoken
alerts jump the queue and interrupt ordinary read-aloud chatter, and they save
and load with the rest of your triggers and highlights.

## Settings

These persist with your profile (see [Configuration & Rules](Configuration)):

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ttsvoicedir` | Folder holding installed voices (default `Voices`) |
| `ttsvoice` | Selected voice folder name (set by `#tts use`) |
| `ttsread` | Master read-aloud on/off |
| `ttsreadstreams` | Comma-separated streams to read aloud |
| `ttsrate` | Speaking speed multiplier, 0.5–3 (default 1) |
| `ttsvolume` | Volume percent, 0–100 (default 100) |

## Coming next

Content-aware grouping (merging *"X arrived" + "X left"* into one short line)
and a travel mode that announces your journey and stays quiet in between.
