# Genie 5

Genie 5 is a cross-platform client for **[DragonRealms](https://www.play.net/dr)**, Simutronics' text MMO. It's a from-scratch rewrite of [Genie 4](https://github.com/GenieClient) on **.NET 8** and **[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/)**, keeping Genie 4's scripting, mapping, highlighting, and triggering while running natively on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

> ⚠️ **Alpha.** Genie 5 is in active development, targeting the most-used ~80% of Genie 4. Expect rough edges. Pages here describe current behavior and flag 🚧 items that are still on the roadmap.

> ⬇️ **Pre-built downloads are here.** As of **v5.0.0-alpha.3.1**, native builds ship for **Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), and Linux**, with an in-app updater on each. Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/releases/latest) — see [Installation](Installation) to pick the right one, and [Releases & Changelog](Releases) for what's new.

This wiki is organized **crawl → walk → run** — the further down you read, the more detail you get. New here? Start at the top and stop when you have what you need.

## Three ways to connect

Genie 5 reaches DragonRealms three ways — all chosen from **File → Connect…**:

- **Simutronics SGE login** — the standard "log in with your DragonRealms account" flow. Genie 5 authenticates and finds the right game server itself.
- **Lich proxy** — point Genie at a running [Lich 5](https://github.com/elanthia-online/lich-5) on `127.0.0.1:8000`; your Ruby scripts keep working.
- **Dev replay** — replay a recorded session through the engine (development and testing).

See **[Connecting & Profiles](Connecting)** for the walkthrough.

> Genie 5 is third-party software for DragonRealms. DR's [Scripting Policy](https://elanthipedia.play.net/Policy:Scripting_policy) asks players to stay responsive to the game — it's the player's call, not the client's. See **[Policy Compliance](Policy-Compliance)** for what that means in practice.
