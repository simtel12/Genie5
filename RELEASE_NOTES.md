# Genie 5 — v5.0.0-alpha.7.3

The **Windows & Maps** release — Genie 4-style per-window controls (a right-click
window menu with timestamps and a Name List Only filter), the window-chrome
settings reorganized under the Layout menu, map landmark labels, and a mapper
routing fix.

> **Alpha software.** Builds are **unsigned** for most platforms — Windows
> SmartScreen will warn on first launch (More info → Run anyway). Signing is
> tracked in #33.

## ✨ New since alpha.7.2

- **Per-window right-click menu (#90)** — right-click any window for the Genie 4
  window menu: **Clear**, **Time Stamp**, **Name List Only**, and **Close**. Each
  window shows only the items it actually supports.
- **Per-window timestamps (#90)** — turn on **Time Stamp** (from that right-click
  menu, or Configuration → Layout → Windows) and every new line in that window is
  prefixed with `[HH:mm:ss]`. Works on the main Game window and every stream/log
  window; existing scrollback isn't re-stamped, and bare prompts are left alone.
- **Name List Only** — filter a window down to just the lines that mention a name
  in your Names list (a clean arrivals / whispers feed). Remembered per window.
- **Window controls moved to the Layout menu** — Hands Strip, Roundtime / Hands
  position, Status Bar, Zone / Room ID, Windowed Mode, and Guild in Title Bar now
  live under **Layout** (alongside save/load arrangement); the **Window** menu is
  now just the panel show/hide list. The per-window settings in Configuration also
  moved under a new **Layout → Windows** sub-tab, matching Genie 4.
- **Map labels** — landmark text the map author placed (gate names, shop names,
  guild houses) is now imported, drawn on the map, and preserved on export.

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Skill / class / circle-gated routing now enforces (#95)** — the pathfinder
  reads your guild and circle from the live game (once you've run `info`), so a
  route is correctly steered around climbs, swims, or guild passages your
  character can't take. Previously that data was read once at startup and never
  refreshed, so the gates never took effect.

# Genie 5 — v5.0.0-alpha.7.2

The **JavaScript libraries** release. Keep a library of JavaScript functions in a
`.js` file, `include` it from a `.cmd`, and call those functions with `js` /
`jscall` — the Genie 4 "array script" pattern — with the functions reading and
writing your `.cmd`'s variables.

> **Alpha software.** Builds are **unsigned** for most platforms — Windows
> SmartScreen will warn on first launch (More info → Run anyway). Signing is
> tracked in #33.

## ✨ New since alpha.7.1

- **Call JavaScript functions from a `.cmd` (#104)** — `include foo.js` loads a
  function library for the running script; **`js <expr>`** runs a function and
  **`jscall <var> <expr>`** stores its result in `%var`. The library reads and
  writes your script's variables through bare `getVar`/`setVar` (→ your `%vars`)
  and `getGlobal`/`setGlobal` (→ `$globals`) — ideal for list/array work that's
  awkward in plain `.cmd`.
- **Genie 4 `.js` libraries port cleanly** — `include` **auto-converts** the old
  `array.length()` (method-call) idiom to standard `array.length`, so existing
  Genie 4 array libraries load and run unchanged. (Genie 4 ran an older JavaScript
  engine; Genie 5's is current and spec-compliant.)
- **New docs** — a **JavaScript Scripting** wiki page covering both standalone
  `.js` scripts and the new function-library interop, with a sample for every call.

# Genie 5 — v5.0.0-alpha.7.1

A **maps & polish** point release on top of the Persistent Core. The headline is
a maps-updater fix; the rest is quality-of-life plus a security fix.

> **Alpha software.** Builds are **unsigned** for most platforms — Windows
> SmartScreen will warn on first launch (More info → Run anyway). Signing is
> tracked in #33.

## 🗺️ Update Maps now pulls *every* map

The updater was silently dropping **13 of the 90 official maps** — including
**Riverhaven** (`Map30`), **Crossing West Gate**, **Shard West Gate**, the
**Southern Trade Routes**, **M'Riss**, **Hibarnhvidar**, and **Fang Cove**. Those
files are saved with a UTF-8 BOM that the XML importer rejected, so every Update
Maps run reported success but left them missing — which is why the mapper showed
**"No zone loaded"** in those areas. The BOM is now stripped on import. **If your
mapper couldn't place you somewhere, re-run File → Update Maps** and the missing
zones fill in.

## ✨ New & quality-of-life

- **Zone / Room ID on the status bar (#66)** — an optional bottom line showing
  your current zone and `$roomid`; a View-menu toggle switches the zone field
  between **name** and the numeric `$zoneid`.
- **Per-script pause/resume + debug level (#94)** — each running-script chip now
  has a **⏸ / ▶** pause button and a **dbg:N** button that cycles the script's
  trace level 0 → 1 → 5 → 10.
- **Atmospherics window (#85)** — a dockable Atmo stream tab (Window →
  Atmospherics).
- **`#echo` colour + mono (#84)** — `#echo Yellow …` renders coloured and
  `#echo mono …` renders monospaced, from the command bar and scripts.
- **`#var` / `#class` `list` & `set` subcommands (#97)** — `#var list` lists
  (instead of filtering by the text "list"), `#var set x 1` sets `x` (instead of
  creating a variable named "set"); plus full multi-row copy in the Variables grid.

## 🔒 Security

- **SGE game-entry key no longer logged (#45)** — the one-time `KEY=` token is
  masked in connection logs.

# Genie 5 — v5.0.0-alpha.7

The **Persistent Core** release. Genie now keeps one live session "brain" for the
whole time the app is open, and that unlocks a lot at once: you can **run scripts
while disconnected**, write a **logon script that connects and keeps running after
you're in the game**, and **switch characters without restarting** — all without
losing your engines, mapper, or trackers. The auto-walker also got a lot smarter
about pacing itself to the game.

> **Alpha software.** Expect rough edges. Builds are **unsigned** — Windows
> SmartScreen will warn on first launch (More info → Run anyway). Signing is
> tracked in #33.

> ⚠️ **Major release — please regression-test.** alpha.7 rebuilds the session
> core (the engine behind your connection, scripts, mapper, rules, and trackers)
> into a single **persistent core**, and significantly changes **auto-walk**
> pacing. That's a large change surface touching things that previously
> "just worked." **Please run your normal workflows — connect, scripts,
> triggers, mapper/travel, multi-character — and report anything that regressed**
> in the regression-testing tracker (#98). Reproduction steps help enormously.
> If something is worse than alpha.6.2, that's a bug we want.

## ✨ New since alpha.6.2

- **Run scripts offline + logon scripts that survive connecting (#88)** — the
  headline. The session core now persists for the whole app run instead of being
  rebuilt on every connect, so:
  - **While disconnected**, you can still run `.cmd`/`.js` scripts, set
    `#var`/`#class`/aliases/triggers, `#edit`, and save your config — handy for
    setting things up before you log in or testing a script offline.
  - A **logon script keeps running across the connect**: a `.cmd` that sets up
    your vars + trigger classes, then `put #connect <profile>`, then does more
    after login, runs straight through — the same script survives the connection.
    (In a `.cmd`, remember a bare `#` line is a comment; run client commands from
    a script with `put #…`, e.g. `put #connect`, just like Genie 4.)
- **Switch characters without restarting** — `#connect <other-profile>` (or the
  connect dialog) cleanly swaps characters in the same session: the previous
  character's rules/variables/classes/skills are cleared and the new character's
  saved config is loaded, while your scripts, mapper, and panels stay alive.
- **Bounded auto-reconnect** — an unexpected drop now retries on a sensible
  ladder (~2 quick tries, then a few longer ones) and **stops after ~1.5–2
  minutes** with a clear *Disconnected* instead of retrying forever. A deliberate
  `quit`/`exit` never auto-reconnects.
- **Smarter auto-walk pacing** — the auto-walker now holds each step until the
  game is ready: it **waits out roundtime** and movement-blocking states
  (stunned/webbed), and **stands you up automatically** when you're sitting,
  kneeling, or prone before it walks. It also no longer reports a false **"No
  path"** before your skills are loaded (gated exits are assumed reachable until
  Genie has read your `info`/`exp`).
- **Built-in trackers + new panels** — **Spell Timer**, **Experience**, and
  **Time Tracker** are now built into Genie (you can delete their old plugin
  DLLs), plus new **Mobs** and **Players** panels that list what's in the room
  (#86).
- **Dock fixes** — a panel you float out (e.g. the Mapper) now reopens **fully
  on-screen** instead of off a monitor edge, and its title bar **double-click
  maximizes / restores** like a normal window.
- Plus a batch of smaller fixes (#80 / #81 / #82) and parser improvements.

## ✅ What works

Connection (Secure SGE / Lich proxy / dev-replay), the StormFront XML parser and
live GameState, the full Genie 4 `.cmd` script engine plus JavaScript `.js`
scripts — now runnable **offline** and **across reconnects** — the rules engines
(`#alias` / `#trigger` / `#highlight` / `#substitute` / `#gag` / `#macro` /
`#class` / `#var`) with `.cfg` persistence and **per-character switching**, the
AutoMapper (click-to-goto, `#goto`, weighted + cross-zone routing, RT/posture-paced
walking), dockable panels with save/load layouts, built-in trackers, the plugin
host, and the in-app updater. See the [README status table](README.md#status) for
the full list.

## 🚧 Not working yet / known gaps

- **Unsigned builds** — SmartScreen warning on Windows (#33).
- **macOS / Linux update channels** — the in-app updater self-updates on Windows
  only; other platforms install fresh builds manually for now (#27).
- **Same-description rooms** — server-uid pacing greatly improves walking through
  identical rooms, but routes through them can still occasionally mis-resolve
  (#76 / #77); `#mapper reset` helps.
- **Skill-gated routing accuracy** — until Genie has read your `info` + `exp`,
  gated exits are *assumed reachable* (so paths aren't blocked); once read, climbs
  and swims you can't take are filtered out.
- **No light theme** yet (single dark palette, #20); no injuries panel (#18); no
  raw-XML inspector window (#14).
