## Genie 4 lineage

Genie 5 is the cross-platform successor to
[Genie 4](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie4), the long-running
Windows client for DragonRealms. Architectural decisions, the `.cmd`
script dialect we stay backwards-compatible with, the rules-engine
vocabulary (`#alias` / `#trigger` / `#highlight` / `#substitute` /
`#gag` / `#macro` / `#var` / `#class`), and the `.map` zone format
all trace back to that codebase. Without the Genie 4 community's
decade-plus of work there would be no Genie 5 to write.
